This repository contains an R Shiny application that can, for now, visualize WEPPCloud summary outputs but is being developed to 
eventually work as a decision support tool.  

At present it has the capability to get WEPPCloud generated hillslope, channel and watershed output files and post-processes them in the back end and perform visualizations both (spatial and non spatial plots) based on the user selected variables. 

## Find this application in action here:

### Caution: 
This is constantly being updated. And new push to the servers can sometimes have bugs resulting in the application being glitchy. However, the basic UI and basic backend file handling has been deployed for now just to test that it works on shiny server.
