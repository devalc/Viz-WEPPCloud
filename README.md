# Viz-WEPPCloud

This repo contains an experimental R shiny app that can visualize WEPPCloud outputs. 

At present it has the capability to get WEPPCloud generated hillslope, channel and watershed output files and preprocesses them in the back end and perform some visualizations based on the selected tabs

### Caution: 
This is still in the developmental phase and is being constantly updated. Only basic UI and basic backend file handling has been deployed for now just to test that it works on shinyapp.io
